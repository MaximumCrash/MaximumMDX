# Component Palette

This page serves as a palette for all the components this project has to offer.

---

#### Definitions

- **WYSIWYG**: What you see is what you get.

- **Component**: A lego block like code element you can use for more advanced content like buttons.

- **MD**: Shorthand for Markdown

- **MDX**: Shorthand for MarkdownExtended (ie. MDX is the name of the rendering engine we use.)

- **Child/Children**: Content that is wrapped by a Component. New lines between content will be recognized as a new child.

- **Child Rule**: A pattern introduced for more complex components that recognized each individual child as a repeatable element of a component. (ie. List, Checklist, ect.)

---

#### Disclaimers

- This palette is primarily to showcase component usage in a vacuum, and to act as helpers.

- Always remember. What you see is what you get. (WYSIWYG). We follow the markdown spec.

- There's no mobile styles for these really. Use at your own risk.

# Accordion

Click the Accordion header to show and hide the content it offers.

The first element is always the header. Every other element will be hidden away.

```js
<Accordion>Hello World This is hidden inside the Accordion.</Accordion>
```

---

<Accordion>

Hello World

This is hidden inside the Accordion.

</Accordion>

---

# Button

It's a button. Not much more to it.

**Dev Note(RÃ©jon): Because this site doesn't provide any stateful functionality (besides light/dark modes), Buttons are built to serve as a unique visual display of links.**

```js
<Button to="/"> ET phone Home </Button>
```

---

<Button to="/"> ET phone Home </Button>

---

# Checklist

<Callout variant="warning" icon="warning">

#### Child Rule in Effect

</Callout>

This is a non-functioning checklist component. It is simply styled to look like one.

```js
<Checklist>
  Child A Child B
  <Box>
    Child C
  </Box>
</Checklist>
```

---

<Checklist>

Child A

Child B

<Box>

Child C

</Box>

</Checklist>

# Chocolate (Box)

<Callout variant="warning" icon="warning">

#### Child Rule in Effect

</Callout>

Originally named "Chocolate Box" components, this component takes into consideration the child rule.
Each child is recognized as a new element. Thus it's recommended for more diverse content to be contained
by a `Box` component.

```js
<Chocolate>
  <Box>
    <Icon size={"40px"} name="maker" />
    ##### Child A Some content about something
  </Box>

  <Box>
    <Icon size={"40px"} name="globe" />
    ##### Child B Some content about something
  </Box>

  <Box>
    <Icon size={"40px"} name="wrench" />
    ##### Child C Some content about something
  </Box>
</Chocolate>
```

# List

The List component is great if you want to display content...in the form of....a list.

<Callout variant="warning" icon="warning">

#### Child Rule in Effect

</Callout>

**To get the most out of lists (ie. headers, subcontent, links) you MUST use a `Box` or `Link` component
based on your specific needs.**

```js
<List>

Element A

Element B

</List>

<List>

<Box>

Element A Header

Some content below the header

Element B with no subcontent
