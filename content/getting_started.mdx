# Getting Started

***TLDR: If you can write a github comment or have experience writing in markdown, you're already ahead of the game.***

This project's goals are inline with providing an onramp into building websites with ease, 
while also providing a base for developing more complex features into markdown focused sites, that many CMS or content/documentation heavy solutions don't allow with ease (or for free). 

You can start off making mdx pages in the **content** folder or if you have existing **.md** files you can copy
and paste them into the content folder at your own pace. 

It's important to know that .md files do **not** allow you to write React components in them. 
**Only .mdx files allow you interweave react components**

If you'd like to learn more about writing in MDX see [their guide](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started).

# Theme-UI

This starter also makes use of [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/home) which has some great MDX tie-ins.

Specifically in this project, you'll find the **gatsby-plugin-theme-ui** folder in the **src** folder and the use of [MakerDAO's dai-ui](https://dai-ui.now.sh/) icon package.

The **index.js** file hosts the theme itself, while **components.js** hosts the components that can be used in your MDX files. 

You can find out more about the gatsby-theme-ui plugin [here](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/).

# Navigation

Lastly, this project is opinionated with some data oriented helpers in place for navigational components like Breadcrumbs, the Header, and the Sidenav. 

You can find more in-depth information about them on the [Navigation page](/navigation).
