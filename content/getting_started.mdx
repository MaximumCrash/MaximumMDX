# Getting Started

This project's goals are inline with providing an onramp into building websites with ease, 
while also providing a base for building/providing more complex features into markdown focused sites. 

You can start off making mdx pages in the content director or if you have existing `.md` files you can copy
and paste them into the content directory at your own pace. 

It's important to not that .md files do **not** allow you to write React components in them. 
**Only .mdx files allow you write react components**

This starter also makes use of [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/home) which has some great MDX tie-ins.
Specifically in this project, you'll find the `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui` folder in the `src` folder. 
The `index.js` file hosts the theme itself, while `components.js` hosts the components that can be used in your MDX files. 
You can find out more about this integration [here](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/).

Lastly, this project has some data oriented helpers in place for navigational components like Breadcrumbs, the Header, and the Sidenav. 
You can find more in-depth information about them on the [Navigation page](/navigation).
