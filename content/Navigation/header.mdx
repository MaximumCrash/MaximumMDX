# The Header and You

The Header is very straight forward. You can find it's component in **src/modules/navigation/Header.js**. 
It's currently built to accept 3 types of frontmatter variables:

1. title
2. header
3. headerOrder

You can find the data being pulled and ordered in from the Header component.

## title (String)

Typical Title Rule shenanigans for label purposes. Learn more about it [here](/navigation#The-Title-Rule)

```
---
title: "Label that shows up on Sidenav, Header, and Breadcrumbs"
---
```

## header (Boolean)

True/False boolean for whether this page should displayed in the header or not. 

```
---
header: true
---
```

## headerOrder (Integer or Float)

By default the Header is order ordered by a priority system:

1. If headerOrder frontmatter exists it takes priority over other header nodes. 
2. The lower headerOrder is the sooner it will show up, you can use any numbers. (ie. 0 is First, 10 would be last, 0.1 would be Second)
3. If the file has header set to true, but no header order then it is ordered by A-Z.

header: true
headerOrder: 0
