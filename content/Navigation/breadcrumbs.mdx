# Breadcrumbs

That little trail of elements with the arrows above is your breadcrumbs component.
It follows similar rules to that of the sidenav's data (since they're both compiled in the same algorithm).

You can find the component inside of the **mdx_layout.jsx** file. 

**Unlike the sidenav and header you cannot control the order of the breadcrumb list**

# Title (String)
